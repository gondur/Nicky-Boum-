Nicky Boum SDL/GBA README
Release version: 0.1.5 (Mar 15 2006)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


About:
------

Nicky Boum is a classic platformer game initially designed for the Amiga. The
game was published my Microids in 1992 and was also ported to the Atari ST and
PC EGA platforms.

This project aims to rewrite the original engine of the game and requires the
original datafiles.

This rewrite is based on the reversing of the Amiga and PC versions.


Requirements:
-------------

You need the original DOS version data files. The list is :

	*.BLK
	*.CDG
	*.REF
	*.SPR

You also need some extra datafiles which can be downloaded from the project 
webpage.


Running the SDL version:
------------------------

Download the extra datafiles package and extract its contents to the directory
containing the original files.

By default, the engine will try to load the game data files from the current
directory. You can change that by using the command line options.

The game keys are :

	Arrow Keys   move Nicky
	Space/Ctrl   action button
	'i'          toggle inventory display
	'p'          pause the game
	F1           cheat mode, gives you all bonuses
	F2           cheat mode, jumps to the next level


Running the GBA version:
-------------------------

The game keys are :

	Keypad       move Nicky
	A/B          action button
	Select       toggle inventory display
	Start        pause the game
	L            cheat mode, gives you all bonuses
	R            cheat mode, jumps to the next level


Missing features:
-----------------

The game logic is fully rewritten, so the game should be completable. Yet, this
rewrite isn't complete as there are still some features that I plan to add :

	- add a highscore screen
	- add a level selection/password screen
	- enable in-game music playback for GBA version
